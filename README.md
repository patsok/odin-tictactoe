# Tic Tac Toe
A game familiar from my childhood - I tried to bring back memories of my school days, when my friends and I would go at every break to play tic tac toe. Of course, for young teenagers the game had endless possibilities, now we know that TTT is fully solved and knowing how to win always ends in a draw - but we can still have fun!

Project inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack Javascript Course.
